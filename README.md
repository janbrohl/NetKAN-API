# NetKAN-API

This is a proof of concept for a web-based API to make pull-requests to NetKAN ( https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/NetKAN ) so changes would only have to be approved by the KSP-CKAN team.

I tested it on a different repo and it seems to work so far but it is totally __NOT__ production-ready
